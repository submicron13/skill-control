# Skill Command & Control

A super simple express server that receives commands from a running Svelte front end server and then forwards it on to a running a Cadence Virtuoso session through IPC.

After finalizing the front end, I plan to run build then move the built html/js/css to the public folder of the express server and get rid of the Cors stuff.

I plan to use something similar to this on the Cadence side:
